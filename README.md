Application for managing bookmarks.
You can create custom folders and than add bookmarks in them.
Each bookmark has its name, description and url (you can change name and description later) and the application
memorizes how many times have you clicked on them.
If you click on the name of the folder it will temporarily hide its content.
On the bottom the application will show you some popular bookmarks that other people have been using.

Example:
    username: primjer@gmail.com
    password: Abc123!
